  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Casseroles never disappoint. They are filling, hearty, and can last you several meals if you’re cooking for
    yourself or a few others. This chicken and rice casserole does just that while being bright and bold thanks to
    lemon, tarragon, and cream of chicken soup. It’s everything you’d want in a chicken and rice soup, but in a
    casserole.</p>

  <p>The chicken thighs are seared quickly in hot oil before finishing in the oven, resulting in tender and moist meat
    with a crispy exterior. If you can’t find cream of chicken soup at the store (or want to try a different option),
    cream of celery or cream of mushroom is a great substitute. Either way, the casserole will come out creamy and
    perfect.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 (6-ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice, rinsed</li>
    <li>1 (10 1/2-ounce) cream of chicken soup</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon, plus more for garnish</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more for garnish</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 lemon, sliced into 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season chicken thighs evenly with salt and pepper on both
      sides.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high. Add chicken thighs to skillet, skin sides down, and cook
      until golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer chicken thighs to a plate; set aside. Do not wipe
      skillet clean.</li>
    <li>Add garlic to drippings in the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 10 to 20 seconds. Add rice,
      cream of chicken soup, lemon juice, lemon zest, tarragon, and crushed red pepper; whisk to combine. Gradually add
      broth, whisking constantly, until combined and smooth. Arrange chicken thighs, skin sides up, over rice mixture
      and place lemon slices over chicken thighs. Cover tightly with aluminum foil or lid, and transfer to the preheated
      oven.</li>
