  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Tartufo is a classic Italian dessert that you can make at home. It requires some patience as there is freezing time
    involved. Rolling the tartufos in pistachio and cookie crumbs is extra delicious.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 quart vanilla ice cream (such as Haagen Dazs®)</li>
    <li>8 maraschino cherries (such as Luxardo®) </li>
    <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil</li>
    <li>36 chocolate wafer cookies (such as Dewey’s Bakery®) (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup salted roasted pistachios (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Let ice cream stand at room temperature until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Line 8 small bowls with
      plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang.</li>
    <li>Using a 2 oz. (1/4-cup) ice-cream scoop, place 1 scoop of ice cream into the bottom of each bowl. Gently press a
      maraschino cherry into the top of each ice-cream scoop, then top each with another 2 oz. (1/4-cup) scoop of ice
      cream. </li>
    <li>Working with 1 bowl of ice cream at a time, gather overhanging plastic, wrap it up around ice cream, and gently
      twist it to form a ball. Freeze until ice cream is firm and set, about 2 hours. </li>
    <li>Place chocolate chips in a large microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on HIGH in (30-second) intervals, stirring
      thoroughly between intervals, until melted, 3 to 4 minutes total. Whisk in coconut oil until oil is completely
      melted and mixture is combined. Let cool slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, pulse cookies and pistachios, if using, in a food processor until finely ground, about 15 quick
      pulses. Transfer to a shallow bowl, and set aside at room temperature.</li>
    <li>Working with 1 ice-cream ball at a time, remove ice-cream ball from freezer. Remove plastic wrap, and place
      ice-cream ball on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Pour chocolate mixture over ice-cream ball,
      allowing it to thinly coat the top and sides.</li>
    <li>If coating in cookie mixture, quickly and carefully invert chocolate-coated ice-cream ball into cookie mixture,
      rolling until evenly coated. Transfer coated ice cream ball to a clean wire rack set inside a large, rimmed baking
      sheet in the freezer. Repeat process with remaining 7 ice-cream balls, returning to the freezer after each one.
      Freeze until set, about 1 hour, or until ready to serve.</li>
  </ol>
